    <p>“When I was in Congress, <strong>I fought to build a strong Washington County that was an economic engine done the right way</strong> - light rail, strong communities, and preservation of our farms and open spaces.</p>

    <p>Over the last 15 years, I've watched progress erode as tax giveaways are handed to land developers, backroom deals are made, and traffic clogging roads stem from unplanned communities.</p>

    <p>I'm running to be your District 4 County Commissioner because I believe <strong>I can bring a much needed change to county leadership, and prioritize what matters: public safety, services for our most vulnerable, education, and preservation of Washington County's farm and forest economy</strong> in a manner that complements our industrial economy.” <br><br>
