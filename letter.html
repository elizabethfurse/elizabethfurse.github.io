        <p>I am running for Washington County Commission District 4 because I believe I can provide much needed change to the leadership of our county.</p>

        <p>Since returning from Congress to my Washington County farm, I’ve watched families struggle to keep their jobs in our economy, our education system weaken, and local services dwindle. At the same time, local leaders use our tax dollars to subsidize land developers and give them free rein to pave over our farmlands and forests at the expense of citizens’ quality of life.</p>

        <p>I believe that in order to strive as a community, we need county officials who serve the public interest, not special interests, and a county agenda that focuses on the basics before paying for extravagant projects and irresponsible giveaways. We need growth, but it must be smart and sustainable, and recognize the value that balanced land use has on the local economy.</p>

        <p>I would be honored to earn your support in this race, so I can do my part to make things better for all Washington County residents.</p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>

        <p>Elizabeth Furse</p>
