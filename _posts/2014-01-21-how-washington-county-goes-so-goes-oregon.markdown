Hi team, 

Since Elizabeth announced her candidacy for Washington County Commission, our local media coverage agrees: this race is "one of major significance to the future of Oregon."

Why is it so important? Because how Washington County goes, so goes Oregon.

Elizabeth wants to live in a county she can be proud of - one that protects our traditional farm economy, that supports schools and public safety, and one that builds communities that make people want to live and work here.

Her one vote can bring that vision to Washington County - but we need your help to get the word out.

It's time we abandon the attitude that economic development is only done Southern California style - with sprawl and freeways that commit us to a lifetime of traffic. It's time we had a fiscally accountable Commission, using tax dollars to pay for schools and public safety rather than tax giveaways to land developers. We can build something special here, but only if you step up.
