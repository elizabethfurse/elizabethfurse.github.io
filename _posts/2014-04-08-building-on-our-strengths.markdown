Friends,

In an [Oregonian article](http://www.oregonlive.com/forest-grove/index.ssf/2014/03/waltz_brewing_bull_run_cider_archimedes_brewing_forest_grove.html) the other day, I read about the growing brewing industry, cider industry, and distilled spirits industry in Forest Grove. These new small businesses are supported in large part due to the fact we have the hops, pears, and apples right here in our backyard. 

It was a good reminder of how important our farmland is to the economy in Washington County and the reason why I talk so much about the need to protect it. It supports an important industry, but it is also a symbol of the kind of economic development I support: focusing on our strengths to attract and build business.

Right now, Oregon is a destination. Intel is here not because we give them the best tax break deal, but because their employees like living here, they can afford to live here, and the schools are good enough to send their kids to.

We need to build on these strengths - improve our schools, maintain our quality of life, protect farmland and open spaces. That will open the doors for more businesses and more jobs. That way we'll be competing with Washington, California, and Colorado for the best jobs, rather than competing with South Carolina and Mississippi's low pay, big box, tax break economic development plans.

To do this we need to get a change on the Washington County Commission. We need to elect leaders who will make developers pay their fair share of our infrastructure costs, who will invest our Gain Share dollars more wisely in schools and services that matter, who will re-prioritize revitalizing our urban cores rather than putting sprawling development over prime farmland.

That's going to take a lot of work over the next 48 days. And I can't do it without you. [Let my team know how you can help](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SHnlxxEdckjiIFhfiLncV4KV_gqiXPz4n2rCE2BvhBE/viewform).

Sincerely,

Elizabeth
