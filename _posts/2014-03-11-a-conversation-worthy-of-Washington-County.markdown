Friends,

With just 70 days left until the election, it's time we start talking about the clear choices in this race for Washington County Commission.

Now that I've had a chance to talk to hundreds of voters at neighborhood house parties and at events across the district, I'm even more confident that people really do want a change. They're tired of a status quo where special interests seem to always win, where our tax dollars are frittered away in tax breaks, and our schools and community services are always on the short end of the stick.

That's not going to cut it if we want to build a Washington County we can all be proud of.

That's why my vision is different. If elected, I will vote to end the millions of dollars in tax breaks to subdivision developers and instead invest in sidewalks and roads so we can get to where we need to safely and quickly. We still have schools in our district that kids can't walk to safely and yet our current Commission insists on wasting our infrastructure dollars on tax breaks to developers instead.

I'll prioritize schools, seniors, and veterans over trophy projects. The current commission continues to waste millions. For example, the Gain Share program: the commission refuses to invest the millions of dollars we're getting from the state through Gain Share in the services our kids and seniors need. I'll fight to keep Gain Share for Washington County, but I'll make sure that our schools, our seniors, our veterans, and the safety of our neighborhoods are on the top of the priority list.

And I'll support our small businesses and farms that account for the majority of jobs created in Washington County. I love our reputation of being the economic engine of the state - and I'll bolster it by promoting the balance between big industry and small and medium sized businesses our community needs for a healthy economy. We can have wheat fields and computer chips thriving side-by-side.

There will be many opportunities in the two months ahead to have these conversations, and the first opportunity involving all of the candidates is next Wednesday, March 19th at 7 PM at the Hillsboro Library. I hope you'll join me to show your support and add your voice to the discussion.
