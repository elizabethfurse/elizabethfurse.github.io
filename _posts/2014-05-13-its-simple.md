Friends,

One week from today, we'll wake up knowing the outcome of this election. I want to make sure we wake up knowing we did all we could to win.

Since getting into this race, I've had conversations with hundreds of people across the district. Parents, small business owners, farmers - whoever it is I talk with - almost everyone agrees: Washington County is a great place to live, but we must work to make it better.

It's time we make it a priority to keep our kids safe by putting in sidewalks outside of the elementary schools that lack them. It's time to make it easier for people to own and operate a small business. It's time we give a leg up to those out of work and struggling to make ends meet. These issues and many others must be addressed NOW to ensure Washington County remains the economic engine of the state. It's how we'll ensure our county remains a desirable place to live.

The solution is simple.

We have county leadership that's not listening to our community. My opponent is part of the majority that isn't investing our money wisely, choosing to use county resources on an events center that voters have twice rejected. My opponent continues to allow developers to not pay their fair share, refusing to think about how we maintain Washington County's livability for future generations when planning our communities.

This is the same board majority that pushed through an illegal plan to expand our Urban Growth Boundary to open agricultural land to sprawl, that still touts our county's success without mentioning the billions of dollars of deferred infrastructure costs on the county books, congested roads, and some of the largest classroom sizes in the state.

Electing new leaders who are willing to prioritize the right things won't solve all of our problems, but it's the first step to addressing them.

This time next week it's my hope we wake up knowing those last phone calls and canvass shifts are what made all the difference. Will you sign up to join me for a shift, or two, in the final five days of the campaign? I guarantee there are voters who still need to hear from you.

Thank you for your support.
