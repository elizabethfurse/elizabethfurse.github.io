That's the question at the top of everyone's mind right now.

Do you know how I know that? Because the majority of voters we talk to on the phones are telling us they're still undecided. And the only reason I can imagine for people being undecided at this point is that they haven't heard from a trusted source about who is worth supporting in this race.

That's where you come in. That's why I'm asking, why do you support Elizabeth Furse?

Whatever your reason is, share it with your friends. Need inspiration? Watch Lyle's reason by clicking on the video above.

This election won't be won by who spent the most money or who sent out the most mailers, it will be won because people like you care enough about the future of our community to do something about it.

So. Why do you support Elizabeth Furse? And is it worth posting something on Facebook? Or sending an email to 5 friends? How about 10? I'll even make it easy for you: here's a template you can use.

It's hard to believe there are only five days left in this election. What's easier to believe is there are still ballots waiting to be filled out. How many of those do you think are in the hands of someone you know? Do you want to leave it to chance? Email your friends now and tell them why you're a supporter.

Thanks for doing this. Your endorsement is the most important one Elizabeth will receive.
