Dear Friends, 
Today, the [Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed citizen appeals by overturning an illegal 50-year growth plan](http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/02/oregon_court_of_appeals_topple.html#incart_m-rpt-2) that would have destroyed our most valuable farmland. This decision supports my calls for a balanced approach to economic growth and it stops the sprawl that could have ruined Washington County. This is a great decision and a great day for our entire county.

In particular, the farmers and citizens from the Helvetia area and north Hillsboro deserve praise. Despite the unlawful actions of the Washington County Board, their persistent efforts in the planning process form the basis of this historic decision. At the same time, this is a victory for all Oregon citizens because it reaffirms the beliefs of Oregonians who love and value our magnificent Oregon farmlands that are at the heart of our land-use laws.

It is obvious to me that the Washington County Commission was determined to take prime farmland and make it into developable, urban property despite citizen and farmer testimony to the contrary. Thousands of hours and thousands of dollars, both public and private, were spent to ensure Washington County followed the law. Shame on them.

Too often, the citizens of Washington County find their input is ignored and that the County Commission has made up its mind before any public hearing is held. With this victory, we can renew our commitment to protecting farms, forestlands, and open space for generations to come by electing new leaders who support Oregon's efforts to limit sprawl and protect our farmlands.

Sincerely,

Elizabeth
