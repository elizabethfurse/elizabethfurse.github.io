<p>From a very young age, Elizabeth learned from her mother if there was something wrong in your community and you had the ability to make things better, it was your duty to try and do that.</p>

<p>Throughout her public service, Elizabeth has kept her mother’s lessons in mind. From activism in anti-apartheid struggles in South Africa, to advocacy for the restoration of Oregon’s terminated Indian Tribes, Elizabeth worked to make a difference.</p>

<p>As a member of the United States Congress from 1993 to 1999 from Oregon’s First Congressional District, which includes Washington County, Elizabeth led the successful effort to bring light rail all the way to Hillsboro, beating out L.A. in the process. She started the Congressional Diabetes Caucus, which grew to 300 Members of Congress and resulted in doubling research dollars for the cause. She also successfully proposed an amendment to the Defense Appropriations Act that trimmed unnecessary Pentagon spending by 5%.</p>

<p> After retiring from Congress, Elizabeth started the Institute for Tribal Government at Portland State University, and taught courses at the Hatfield School of Government. She currently sits on the boards of various organizations including the Warm Springs Tribes’ Kah-Nee-Ta Resort Board, Water Watch Oregon, Save Helvetia, and Tamaslikt Museum on the Umatilla Reservation.</p>

<p>Elizabeth and her four dogs live on a Washington County farm and vineyard adjoining the Helvetia Winery that she and her husband started in 1996.</p>
