        <h3>Education and Basic Services to Make Washington County Great</h3>

        <p>In order to strive as a community, county government needs to serve the public interest, not any one interest.  We need a county agenda that focuses on what Washington County citizens need before paying for extravagant projects and irresponsible giveaways. This means a focus on education so families want to live here, public safety so people feel at home here, and transportation so people can get from here to there in a way that fits their busy lives and benefits our local businesses.</p>

        <h3>A Washington County Commission that Puts People First</h3>

        <p>The Commission should share the community’s priorities.  It’s time we earn back the trust of residents who see the county working for a very few at the expense of all of us.  We’re frustrated: the County cuts developer taxes, the Commission spends precious dollars on roads that go nowhere and trophies that don’t solve our transportation challenges, and then they increase citizen taxes to fill basic service gaps. There are problems, but they’re easy to change - invest resources into sidewalks for kids, safe roads, schools and public safety.  I’ll listen to what people need, and I’ll work hard to deliver.</p>

        <h3>Economic Growth that Builds on Washington County’s Values</h3>

        <p>We need growth, but it must be smart and sustainable, and aware of the added benefits a balanced land use system has on our local economy. Our lands produce sustainable products traded throughout the world.  They provide fresh air, clean water, and the quality of life that draws families and industry to Washington County. Our farms and forests are as valuable as our fab plants – they complement each other and more should be done to make sure they thrive together. This means prioritizing our best farmland and working to build communities where people can live, work, and send their kids to schools all in the same community.</p>
